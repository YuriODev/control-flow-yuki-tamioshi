Here are some examples to get you started.

**Covered topics:** 
- **Branching** (Conditional Statements)

## Example 1: Temperature Feedback Messages
**Problem:** Write a program where the user enters a temperature value, and if this value is less than or equal to `0` degrees Celsius, you need to display the message "A cold, isn‚Äôt it?". If the temperature is more than `0` and less than `10` degrees Celsius, the message will be "Cool.". In other cases, "Nice weather we‚Äôre having.".

| No. | Inputs | Outputs                         |
| --- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| 1   | 12.5   | Nice weather we're having.      |
| 2   | -5     | A cold, isn't it?               |
| 3   | 9      | Cool.                           |

## Example 20: Identical Digits Counting
**Problem:** Given a three-digit integer. Determine the number of identical digits in the number record and output the value of this quantity.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 123    | 0       |
| 2   | 111    | 3       |
| 3   | 121    | 2       |
| 4   | 100    | 1       |

<summary><b>Python Solution</b></summary>

```python
# Input: A three-digit integer
number = int(input("Enter a three-digit number: "))

# Extract digits
first_digit = number // 100
second_digit = (number % 100) // 10
third_digit = number % 10

# Initialize count
count = 0

# Count identical digits using direct comparison
if first_digit == second_digit == third_digit:
    count = 3
elif first_digit == second_digit or first_digit == third_digit or second_digit == third_digit:
    count = 2

# Prepare the output message
output = f"{count}"

# Print the output message
print(output)

## Example 21: Next Day Date Validation
**Problem:** Write a program in which the user enters the value of the current date: day, month, and year (integer numbers), and the program outputs tomorrow's date in the format: `dd.mm.yyyy`.

| No. | Inputs | Outputs |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| 1   | 1<br>1<br>2020 | 02.01.2020 |
| 2   | 28<br>2<br>2020 | 29.02.2020 |
| 3   | 31<br>12<br>2020 | 01.01.2021 |
